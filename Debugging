1. CrashLoopBackOff – Wrong Command
command: ["python", "main.py"] → file is app.py.

- This happens because of main.py file instead of app.py file where all our code is.


2. Ingress Route Failure
Ingress routes /backend but backend listens on /api.

-In ingress we have to change path from /backen to /api because in backend listens at /api


3. Terraform Backend Error
Missing bucket/container name.

-In this case either we haven't passed container name of s3 bucket or name is wrong.

4. FluentBit Log Path Bug
Incorrect path: *.logx instead of *.log.

-We will change path from *.logx to *.log. , because our logs lies in .log files.
